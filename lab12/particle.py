        This method checks if the two particles collide and, if so, modifies
        the positions and velocities to reflect the result of the collision.

        The result is reasonably physically accurate, but limited by being
        run only *after* a collision has already occurred.

        Both objects are changed, so this method should only be run once for each pair of objects.
