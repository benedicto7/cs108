#2 + 3 * 5 is equal to 17, doing the multiplication first.
#8 - 4 - 2 is equal to 2.
#(3 + 7) * 2 is equal to 20, doing the parenthesis first.
#13 % 4 gives 1 because it gives the remainder.
#8.2 // 4 gives 1 decimal place because there is a single float.
#2**10 gives 1024 as it is the power of 10.
#5.1 % 2 is surprising because it gives 1.0999999999999996, instead of a clean whole number.
